            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.A right to education has been
                recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to
                a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"> There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for
                evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,
                which promotes quality education for all.Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in
                the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher
                learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to
                Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece.In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of
                Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to
                influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered
                disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his
                Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the
                modern era.[5]

                The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl
                called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of
                strengthening or bringing up men".</p>
